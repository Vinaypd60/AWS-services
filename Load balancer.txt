2)network load balancer
3)Gatewaay load balancer
4)Classic load balancer(Old one AWS removed)


Application LBR:
if we want to implement LBR for the application with http and https then go for APPLICATION LBR.

Network LBR:
If we want to implement LBR the ultra performance should go for NW LBR.

Gateway LBR:
if our application is having third party appliences then go for the Gateway LBR.
