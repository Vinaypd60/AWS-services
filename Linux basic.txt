                                           **************************Linux basic*************************

1)Linux OS comes into the market in the year of 1991.
2)Linux developed by the one student his name is "Linus Torvald"
3)So many ppl taken linux os source code and re-designed into market with their brand names.(Linux distributions) 
  Example:Ubuntu cent OS RHEL Federo SUSE Kali etc.
4)Linux OS is multi-user based OS.
5)Linux OS is highly secured.

                                           -----------Linux Archietecture-------------
1)Hardware  = It consist of all the physical devices attached to the system.
              Example:Hardisk RAM cpu Motherboard.
2)Kernel    = It is the important component of which will interact with hardware directly.
3)Shell     = Shell is the mediator between the user and the kernel.
4)Application = Appli are the utilities which runs on the shell.
                Example:Notepad browser media player.

*********************Linux filesystem***********************

In linux OS everything will be treated as a file only.
Linux files are divided into three types.
1)Ordinary files = The files which contains the data i.e; .pem .ppk binary(Image audio video)files.
2)Directory files(Blue-color) = Is nothing but the folders in the liux.
3)Device files = IN LINUX everything is a file by using this file we can communicate with devices.

-------How to check Files types-------
To display all the files withits type we will use "ls -l" command.

d-->Directory files
- --->Ordinary files
l --->Link files

                            ------Linux files system hierarchy--------

In the linux everything will be treated as a file.
Every single file and directory starting from root dir(/)

/ = Root directory(Entry point of the file  system)
bin = User command binaries
boot = static files of the boot loader
dev = device files
etc = system-global configuration files
home = users home directory
lib = shared lib
media = removable media
mnt = mounted file system
opt = add on app package sw
sbin = sysytem binaries
srv = data for services from system
tmp = temp files
usr = user utility and application
var = var files
Proc = process files(Kernal info)

                           --------Working with Linux Commands--------

Whoami = it will display the logged in user.
PWD = Present working directory
CD .. = change directory
Date = will dispaly the date
cal = will display the calculator
ls = will dispaly the list
ls -r = will display the files and directories in rev of alphabetical order
ls -l = will display the long listing of files
ls -t = will display the files based on last modified data and time.
ls -ltr = will print old modified dates and time files in the rev order.
ls -la = will display the hidden files(.)along with all files including(..)
ls -li (or)i = will display the Inode(Number)
ls -lf = will display the based upon on type.
ls -la = except . and ..files.
 
Note:
We can execute command with multiple options also.

                            ---------Date and time command----------

date = it will print the todays date
date+%D
date +%T,%C,%d,%m,%Y,%H,%M,%S
date +%d-%m-%y



                               ---------How to create directory---------

mkdir =  to create make directory.
mkdir dir1 (ls -l)example:Vinay
cd vinay
cd .. (Backword or outside of the folder)

                           -------To create files inside the folders----------

mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
mkdir dir5/dir22
rm -r <dir-name> (it will remove the non-empty files)
tocuh file.txt(it will create empty files)
cat > file.txt(create a file with content)
cat >> file.txt (to append the content)
cat file.txt (to print the content)

Example:Create one file with content

Touch file.txt
cat > file.txt ---->after that content---->cntrl D
cat file.txt


                                           ---------HEAD COMMAND-----------

The "Head" command will displayed the starting content of a file.
Bydefault it will display the starting 10-lines of any file.

Example:
Head file.txt
head -4 file.txt(it will print 4-lines)

1)Head command for multiple files:
Head file.txt vinay.txt

2)head c command:
The head-c command count the no.of bytes of a files.
example:head -c <num><filename>
        head -c 30 vinay.txt


                                             -----------Tail command-----------

It is used to display the last 10-lines of the one (or) more files.
Its main purpose is used to read the error msgs.

Example:
        tail Vinay.txt
        tail -n 3 Vinay.txt(it will print the 3lines)
        tail c 8 Vinay.txt
        tail -f Vinay.txt (latest changes)



                                                      ------WORD COUNT-------

It contains the word count
Example:
        WC Vinay.txt
         8-lines
         30-word 
         225-Char

                                                  --------Copy the files from----------

To copy the files from one to another we will use "CP" command.
Ex:
   CP vinay.txt rahul.txt

                                                    --------Both files at a time---------

It can print the both file data
Exapmle:
        Cat vinay.txt rahul.txt 

                                          --------Copy the two files data into another file----------

Example:
        cat Vinay.txt > rahul.txt
        cat rahul.txt

                                                      ---------Editors----------
