                                     ****************************ROUTE 53***********************************

Route53 is nothing but the DNS service related.
Example: 
        HTTP = 80
        HTTPS = 443
        DNS = 53
Thats why they named it as route53.

route53 services is used to map application domain name to machine server IP.
When will provide domain names for end users.
when user access domain in browser then ROute53 will route that request to server IP where Application is running.


Example:
       (Actual URL)https://vinay.org.s3 ----> (Beautiful URL)www.vinay.org

This proces is called as domain name servcie mapping.

Note:
To map DNS we have to purchase domain first.
In AWS domain charges are depends upon our requirement.(.in .com .info .org .edu)
We can register the domains minimum.

Procedure to configure DNS mapping:
1)Register domain usign route53 "reg domain" option.
2)Goto Billings dashboard and bill amount
3)Create hosted zone with our domain name.


Note:
1)name servers of vinay.org and hosted zone both should be same servers.
2)if not site can't be work it throughs an error.
