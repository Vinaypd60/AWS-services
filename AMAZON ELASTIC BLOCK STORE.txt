                             **************************AMAZON ELASTIC BLOCK STORE***************************

1)In AWS we have EBS for storing the data permanently(its stored in volumes)
2)EBS stands for "Elastic block storage".
3)In EBS we will create volumes to store the data.
4)volumes behaves like raw.
5)we can attach volumes to EC2 instances.
6)volumes are divided into two types.
  a)ROOT b)EBS


EBS:
It is permanent storage
No data will be loss
maximum size 16TB
for free tier =30gb

Instance store volume:
temporary storage
data will not permanent
instance store volumes are free.

EBS Volumes types:
1)General purpose volume
2)throughput 
3)cloud
4)magnetic(standard)
5)provisioned IOPS volume


LAB-EBS:
Create EC2
Storage root-vol-8GB / add EBS-VOL 5GB
Connect to EC2
df -h
lsdlk
sudo mkfs -t ext4/dev/xvdb
sudo mkdir/ app-vol
sudo mount / dev/xvdb/app-vol


This will successfully mount our volume with EC2
now we need to transsfer the volume
   -sudo umount / dev /xvdb

Goto volumes
     - Select 5GB volumes
     - Actions
     - Create snapshot



                                        ---------------Elastic file system----------------------
Amazon elastic file system is a cloud storage provided by amazon web services designed to provide\
scalable,elastic concurrent with some restriction and encrypted file storage for use both AWS cloud 
services and on-premises resources.


                                             -------------Network file system--------------

NFS is a distributed system protocol originally developed by sun-microsystem in 1984.
It allows users on a client computer to access files over a computer network muck like local storage.

LAB-EFS:
Create two instances accross 2-AZS
Goto EFS
Create EFS

EFS needs a port with 2049

Go to SG
create SG-2049
Goto EFS 
Goto NW
Manage NW
Add SG-2049

Once SG is added 

Select EFS 
Selecta attach
Mount via DNS
copy the Address and paste it in EC2.
