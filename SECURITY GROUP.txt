Security Groups are used to configure Inbound and outbound rules for EC2.
1)Inbound rules will decide who can access our EC2.
2)Outbound rules will decide what our EC2 can access.
3)Bydefault all Inbound and outbound traffic is denied in EC2 and outbound traffic is allowed.
4)If we want to allow the traffic for EC2 then we have configure the Inbound rules.
